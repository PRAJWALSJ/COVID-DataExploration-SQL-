# COVID-DataExploration-SQL-
Data Exploration of Covid dataset from ourworldindata.org website using SQL. This project includes calculation of attributes like DeathPercentage, PercentPopulationInfected, TotalDeathCount, RollingPeopleVaccinated etc. I believe more explorations can be done as the purpose of this project was to apply basic knowledge of SQL in exploring a real-life scenario(COVID-19 Outbreak). The queries cover basic SQL functions, window functions, and CTEs
